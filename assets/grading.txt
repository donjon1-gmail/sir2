The grade scheme is as follows:

A    4.00        C    2.00		
B+  3.50        D+  1.50
B    3.00        D    1.00	
C+  2.50	

The College grading policy requires that a grade of C is the minimum grade that would be regarded as a "passing grade." 

A grade of D+, and D will be regarded as a "failing grade."

There will be an Examination incorporated into each semester. 

Accumulated marks in the first and second semester will be weighted proportionately.
